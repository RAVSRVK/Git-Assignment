Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another.

Use Case:
A commit is accidently made to the wrong branch. You can switch to the correct branch and cherry-pick the commit to where it should belong.

Steps to do it:

1. Checkout to the branch to which you want to switch the commit by using the below command 
	
	command: "git checkout <branchName>"
	
2. Run the below cherry pick command for switch the commit to current branch
	
	command: "git cherry-pick <commitReference>"
